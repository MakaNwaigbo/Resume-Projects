# Hello Everyone 
My name is Nneamaka Amanda Nwaigbo and I am a 21-year-old college student aspiring to finally step into the cybersecurity world. I started out with cybersecurity and I want to venture out and learn more about the coding world and developing software or websites. I have a knack for starting personal projects and love to learn new things every day. I have some examples of coding projects that I worked on while I was in my Python coding class in college. I am now taking online courses to strengthen my existing knowledge in Python and add on to SQL and JavaScript. If you are looking for a future 2024 bachelor's graduate who loves working on projects and has a passion for technology, I am the person for you! Shoot me an email if you are interested. Thank you for viewing my page!

Sincerely, 
Nneamaka Nwaigbo
